# LaserBattleship
A tabletop game to teach students linear equations

## About the Game
The game consisted of a grid table, a laser device, and a target device.  Students were to use the grid on the table to calculate the equations of lines that would allow them to fire their laser at the targets on a ship.  The laser device would create a laser sound effect when firing, and if the target was hit, it would light up a corresponding LED and play an explosion sound

## My Role
I designed and fabricated the devices, as well as the grid tables.  My colleague developed the rules for the game and the learning objectives for the students.
